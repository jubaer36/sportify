## API Architecture

### Controller Layer
The application implements a comprehensive REST API with the following controllers:

1. **AuthController** - Authentication and authorization endpoints
2. **UserController** - User management operations
3. **SportController** - Sports CRUD operations
4. **TeamController** - Team management
5. **TournamentController** - Tournament lifecycle management
6. **MatchController** - Match scheduling and management
7. **ScoreController** - Live score updates
8. **AnnouncementController** - News and announcements
9. **HallOfFameController** - Achievement tracking
10. **NotificationController** - User notifications

### Service Layer
Each controller is backed by corresponding service classes that implement business logic:
- SportService, TournamentService, UserService, etc.

### Repository Layer
Spring Data JPA repositories provide data access:
- Custom query methods for complex searches
- Standard CRUD operations
- Specialized queries for sports statistics
